    "#### In this project, we developed a **cancer prediction** model using advanced machine learning techniques. After testing various algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and XGBoost), we selected the best models through RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization. We then combined the top models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) using ensemble techniques: Voting and Stacking. To further improve performance, we fine-tuned the classification threshold by analyzing the ROC Curve and optimizing it based on Youden’s J statistic. The final model achieves an F1 Score of 0.98 on the test set, with an AUC of 0.996, demonstrating excellent predictive performance and a strong balance between precision and recall."
